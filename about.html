About Us

Founded in 2020, CARS24 is a tech-enabled used cars disruptor. It is India’s largest platform for buying and selling used cars with presence across more than 124 major cities in India. Unlike conventional buying & selling methods such as classifieds, our unique business model offers you the best price in the fastest possible time with expert assistance from start to finish. Since our inception, we have come a long way - from one office to more than 230 branches across 124+ major cities in India. CARS24 is defined by its people - the owners of the business! We are a team of exceptionally driven, capable people solving a real consumer problem.
Our Mission

CARS24's mission is to revolutionize the way used cars are transacted in India. We endeavour to offer an efficient, reliable and hassle-free transacting experience for used cars.
Our Values

Values and ethics of a company define how organized and structured an organization is. As a company, we have our own set of values that we believe in and abide by.
Ownership

We don’t want our employees to be managed, but we want them to take control. At CARS24, we believe that a great workplace is defined not by the founders or top management but, by the number of ‘owners’ in the organization.
Investing in Employees and Partners

We don’t want to raise capital, but to raise our people and partners. At CARS24 we don’t think of our success in just profitability and IPO but, in making our employees & partners super successful in life. We believe in the maximum, ‘Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime’.
High Standards and High Results

We don’t settle for less, instead, we focus on more. At CARS24, we don’t gloat in what has been achieved but, focus on doing them even better.
Meritocracy

We won’t let exceptional performance go unrewarded; our aspirations are bigger than they appear at CARS24, we don’t think of meritocracy as a ‘cut-throat’ phenomenon’; that there is only a ‘fixed’ number of opportunities but, we believe that larger the number of talented people, the more we can dream and accomplish in all regards.
Trust

We won’t get successful until there is a strong and deep trust with each and every stakeholder. At CARS24, we don’t think we do everything today to say we are extremely trustworthy but, we are aware this is a key tenet of what we do, and we work hard with committed goals and timelines to ensure we are ever-improving.
Frugality

We don’t try to be penny wise, pound foolish but, we won’t spend when it doesn’t ‘add value'. At CARS24, we believe that a great workplace is not the ones with fanciest offices, biggest parties, and free food, but, the one that makes real & healthy profits as first priority over everything else.
Long Term

In our minds, we are clear that doing the best work of our lives will be a very long journey. At CARS24, we believe that we will succeed not just by achieving quarterly/ yearly milestones but, knowing that those milestones were achieved without zero compromises on our long-term plan.
